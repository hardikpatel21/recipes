Perfect hard boiled eggs: http://www.incredibleegg.org/cooking-school/egg-cookery/hard-boil-eggs/
Method:

1. In a small non-stick skillet heat 1 teaspoon of oil on medium heat. Break one egg into the skillet and half fry it – white is fully cooked and yellow is semi-solid. Once cooked, remove fried egg from the skillet and set aside.
2. Hard-boil the remaining eggs. Once ready, de-shell them and use the large side of a box grater to grate them. Set aside.
3. In a medium non-stick skillet heat ½ tablespoon of cooking oil along with the butter on medium heat. Add the onions and cook until the onions are soft and translucent. Keep stirring occasionally to ensure the onions don’t brown.
4. Add in the garlic paste and ginger paste and cook for 1-2 minutes until the raw garlic smell dissipates.
5. Now add the tomatoes, green chillies and ½ a teaspoon of salt. Cook till the tomatoes are fully cooked through and soft. Now add the turmeric powder, chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin powder along with 2 tablespoons of water and cook for 2-3 minutes.
6. Now add the half fried egg and use a vegetable or potato masher and mash everything together to a coarse texture.
7. Add in the grated boiled eggs and cilantro and cook for another 3 minutes. Season with salt per your taste.
8. Remove from the heat. Garnish with cilantro and serve warm with bread or pav.
